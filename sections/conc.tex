Blockchain is being employed all over the world for all sorts of purposes, and we have managed to fit it into our problem scenario, and design a solution to fulfill all of our goals without many modifications. 
\\Other solutions, such as the BAF-model discussed earlier, may be more suitable, but is also highly specialized, as it is only designed to handle log-data. Our model uses a general purpose design, based on proven security and scalability.
\\Overall, we have learned that blockchain is not limited to maintaining bitcoin transactions, but can be used to solve all sorts of real-world problems, concerning distributed information sharing. 
\\It is our overall conclusion that we solved the problem fully, and gained valuable knowledge into one of the most important pieces of technology of our time, arguably.
