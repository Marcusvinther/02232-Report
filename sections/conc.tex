Blockchain is being employed all over the world for all sorts of
purposes, and we have managed to fit it into our problem scenario, and
design a solution to fulfill all of our goals without many
modifications.

Other solutions, such as the BAF-model discussed earlier, may be more
suitable, but is also highly specialized, as it is only designed to
handle log-data. Our model uses a general purpose design, based on
proven security and scalability.

We have learned that blockchain is not limited to maintaining bitcoin
transactions, but can be used to solve all sorts of real-world
problems, concerning distributed information sharing. It is our
overall conclusion that we solved the problem fully, and gained
valuable knowledge into one of the most important pieces of technology
of our time, arguably.

In a future work it could be interesting to implement the solution proposed in this report, and benchmark the solution against the related solutions presented in this report.
