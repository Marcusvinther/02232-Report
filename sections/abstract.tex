Logging systems are a central part of digital forensics, where it
is one of the most valuable source of information which describes
the current and past state of a given system. This information
can not only be used after the fact, but also concurrently, in
real time, to actively monitor and detect faults and intrusions.

In a scenario where a network of computers are audited by a
central logging server, with the purpose of monitoring the state and
possible compromise of any or multiple units, the integrity of
the logging content and sequence there of, are of paramount
importance. The compromise of a unit should be detected and not
effect the central servers ability in detecting further faults
in the network.

In this report, we research how suitable blockchain technology, such
used by the Bitcoin crypto currency, is for securing logfiles in large
distributed systems. We analyse cryptographic properties such as
integrity, confidentiality and computational costs, where after we
discuss whether they are applicable to our problem scenario.

We show that blockchains is a suitable candidate for a logging system,
as it solves all the previously mentioned challenges, offering
flexibility and effectiveness.
