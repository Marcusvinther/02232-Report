\subsection{Blockchain technology}

A blockchain is in principle a quite simple database techonolgy for
distrebuted systems. It uses a handful of existing technologies, such
as distrebution, consensus, digital signatures and cryptography.  Each
entry in the database, called a \textit{block}, contains a timestamp
and a link to the privous entry, hence the chain. The link is simply a
hash of the privious record, which means that if someone changes
something in a block further back, the hash for that record would not
match the hash in the following record, immediately breaking the
chain.

The blockchain is distrbuted over a set of peers, whom all communicate
directly, i.e. a decentralized system or peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
